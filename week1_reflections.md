**After week 1 of Advanced Python, some content that I can reflect on from what I have learned include:**
- Refresher on creating a Pokemon object with attributes and methods
- Object oriented programming concepts
- Brief summary about data structures and how to efficiently organize and store data
- Learned or refreshed about the different types of data structures such as: records, array, linked lists, binary trees, hash tables, heaps, and graphs
- What algorithms and abstract data types are

Example - Pokemon Class contructed: 

'''
class Pokemon:
    def __init__(self, name, ptype, hp, attack, spattack, defense, speed):
        self.name = name
        self.type = ptype
        self.hp = hp
        self.attack = attack
        self.spattack = spattack
        self.defense = defense
        self.speed = speed
'''
